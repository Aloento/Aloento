## Missing Values

Explain how would you pre-process the data if you would like to use linear classification/regression methods and the data would contain only categorical/nominal attributes. What could we do with missing values in this case?

<details>

解释如果您希望使用线性分类/回归方法，并且数据仅包含分类/名义属性，您将如何预处理数据。在这种情况下，我们可以如何处理缺失值？

Class 用 One-Hot，有序类别还能用 Label Encoding。
缺失值可以用众数（Mode Imputation）填充，或者用模型（如 KNN）填充。

</details>

## Evaluation

Explain how internal and external evaluation of clusters work.

<details>

解释聚类的内部评估和外部评估是如何工作的。

内部：不依赖真实标签，簇内相似度是否高、簇间差异是否大，如 Silhouette Score
外部：依赖已有的真实标签，与聚类结果进行比较

</details>

## Regularized LR

Write down the objective function for regularized linear regression. Explain, under which values (high or small) of the regularization hyper-parameter, the resulting model will overfit or underfit.

<details>

写出正则化线性回归的目标函数。解释在正则化超参数的高值或低值下，模型会过拟合还是欠拟合。

Ridge: $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_j^2$

$\lambda$ 大：简单，欠拟合
$\lambda$ 小：复杂，过拟合

</details>

## Error

What is the relation between the prediction error on the test set and the model complexity?

<details>

测试集上的预测误差与模型复杂度之间有什么关系？

U 形关系：模型太简单或太复杂，误差都高。最佳复杂度在中间。

## Binary

What is a possible way to classify color images of animals to three different classes using binary classification methods? How would you represent the data? How would you do cross-validation in this case (i.e. how would you select the folds)?

<details>

使用二元分类方法将动物的彩色图像分类为三个不同类别的一种可能方法是什么？您将如何表示数据？在这种情况下，您将如何进行交叉验证（即，您将如何选择折叠）？

One-vs-Rest，将三类问题拆分为三个二元分类器，每个分类器负责识别某一类别。
转换为数值特征，如 CNN。
使用 Stratified k-fold CV，确保每个类的比例相同。

## Metric

Verify if $\mathbf{d(x,y)} = \max(|x - y|, 1)$ a distance measure for two binary strings $x$ and $y$ of equal length satisfies the properties of a metric.

<details>

验证 $\mathbf{d(x,y)} = \max(|x - y|, 1)$ 是否满足作为两个等长二进制字符串 $x$ 和 $y$ 的距离度量的性质。

1. 非负，因为绝对值和 max 都是非负的
2. 对称，因为 $|x - y| = |y - x|$
3. 等价，不满足，因为 $d(x,x) = 1$，而不是 0

所以不满足度量的性质。

</details>

## Linkage

Provide a scenario or a dataset where complete linkage clustering would be less effective and justify your reasoning.

<details>

提供一个 complete linkage 聚类效果较差的场景或数据集，并说明您的理由。

具有不同密度或非球状簇的数据集。
因为 complete 产生紧凑，球状的簇。

</details>

## Equation

Given the following equation: $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_j^2$, what do the components of this equation represent? Discuss the impact of using very small and very large values of $\lambda$.

<details>

给定以下方程：$ \sum*{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}\_i)^2 + \lambda \sum*{j=1}^{p}\beta_j^2 $，该方程的各部分代表什么？讨论使用非常小和非常大的 $\lambda$ 值的影响。

1. 第一项：训练误差，在训练集上的拟合程度
2. L2 正则化项，控制模型复杂度
3. $\lambda$ 大：模型简单，欠拟合
4. $\lambda$ 小：模型复杂，过拟合

</details>

## Multi-Class

How can logistic regression be modified to perform multi-class classification?

<details>

如何修改逻辑回归以执行多类分类？

One-vs-Rest：每个类别训练一个二元分类器，预测“该类 vs 其他”
Softmax 回归：将所有类别的概率归一化为 1

</details>

Explain the concept of k-fold cross-validation and describe the steps involved in performing it.

<details>

解释 k 折交叉验证的概念，并描述执行它所涉及的步骤。

一种模型评估方法，用于更可靠地估计模型在未见数据上的表现。

1. 将数据集平均分成 k 个子集
2. 选择一个子集作为验证集，其他 k-1 个子集作为训练集
3. 训练模型并在验证集上评估性能
4. 重复 k 次，计算平均值
