# 1. DS & ML

What are the main differences between DS and ML, and how do their goals and functionalities differ even though they are closely linked?

# Lifecycle

Enumerate the steps involved in the DS lifecycle. Highlight the key tasks and considerations at each stage?

# Hamming

Consider two objects represented by binary strings:
A = 110010, B = 101011.
Define and calculate the Hamming distance between A and B.
Can we use the Hamming distance if A and B have different lengths and why?

# Metric

Under which conditions is a distance measure a metric?
Demonstrate that the Hamming distance is a metric.
Provide explanations and calculations to support each part of the proof.

# K-Means

What are the hyper-parameters of K-means clustering and how do we set them?

# Agglomerative

In hierarchical agglomerative clustering, how would you determine the optimal number of clusters without relying on pre-defined stopping criteria?

# DBSCAN

If you set a large value for $\epsilon$ in DBSCAN, what would be the potential consequences on the clustering results?

# Regression

Discuss the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.

# Gradient

Describe the process by which gradient descent is employed to refine the parameters of a linear regression model.

# Regularization

How does regularization help overcome the challenges associated with using polynomial regression models?
Particularly in mitigating overfitting and controlling model complexity?
