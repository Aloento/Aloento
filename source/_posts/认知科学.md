# 考试

## I. Philosophy of Mind & Consciousness

### 1. What is dualism and what solutions have been proposed?

什么是二元论？它的解决方案是什么？

它认为 body 和 mind 是两个本质不同的 entities。
解决方案有 materialism, idealism，functionalism 和 behaviorism 等。
它们试图解释心物之间如何互动。

### 2. What is dual interactionism and what did Descartes hold about the place of interaction?

什么是双向交互论？笛卡尔认为交互发生在什么地方？

它认为心灵与身体可以互相 influence。
笛卡尔认为交互发生在松果体（pineal gland）中。

### 3. What is the mind-body problem?

什么是心身问题？

mind 如何与 body 相互作用，或者 mind 是否独立于 body 存在。

## II. Foundations of Cognitive Science

### 4. Characterize Cognitive Science! What is cognition?

认知科学的特点？什么是认知？

研究 mind 和 intelligence 的 interdisciplinary 研究。
认知是信息的 acquiring, processing, storage 和 using 的过程。

### 5. What is functionalism and what does it hold about the mind and the body?

什么是功能主义？它对心灵和身体有什么看法？

它认为 mental states 由其功能角色定义，而非物质构成。
心灵可以 realized in different substrates，只要功能相同。

### 6. What are qualia and what does functionalism hold about them?

什么是感质？功能主义对它们有什么看法？

qualia 是 subjective experiences 的 qualities。
功能主义通常被认为无法解释感质，因为它关注的是功能而非主观体验。

### 7. Characterize pain as a functional state

请将疼痛作为一个功能状态进行描述

它是引发 attention, harm avoidance 导致特定行为（如 screaming）的功能状态。不依赖于其物理实现。

📄 [Putnam's paper on Functionalism](https://web.stanford.edu/~paulsko/papers/PutnamNMS.pdf)

## III. Intentionality and Meaning

### 8. What is intentionality?

什么是意向性？

它是指 mental states to be directed at or about something.
比如思想可以关于某个对象或事件。

📄 [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Intentionality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/)

### 9. What is the difference between intrinsic and derived intentionality?

内在意向性和派生意向性有什么区别？

intrinsic intentionality is inherent to mental states, while derived intentionality is assigned by external factors.

📄 [MIT resource](https://web.mit.edu/abyrne/www/intentionality.html)

### 10. What is the meaning of substrate independence?

什么是载体独立性？

心智状态不依赖于特定的 physical substrate，只要其 functional structure 相同。

📄 [Edge.org article](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27126)

### 11. Give an example of the problems of functionalism

举例一个功能主义的问题

"Chinese Room" 指出，即时功能相同，也未必拥有相同的 conscious experience。

📄 [Block's critique](https://www.nedblock.us/papers/1978.troubles.with.f.pdf)

## IV. Social Cognition & Theory of Mind

### 12. What is Machiavellian intelligence? Mention a positive example

什么是马基雅维利式智能？举一个正面的例子

指 use of social manipulation to enhance survival. e.g. a child pretending to cry to get attention. 或者 A wants B to believe a false proposition.

2nd level in the intentional ladder, A wants B to believe that p
manipulation e,g, false belief induction

📄 [Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellian_intelligence_hypothesis)

## V. Language & Learning

### 13. What are Chomsky’s ideas for natural language acquisition and their criticism?

乔姆斯基对自然语言习得的观点及其批评

language acquisition relies on innate abilities.
teaching input is insufficient and low in quality.

Critics argue：there is enough time, opportunities, infants recognizing teaching mode

arguments for motherese:
the teaching input is (utterances babies are confonted with)
 too little
 too „bad“ (low quality)
heavily criticized:
there is enough time, opportunities, „sessions“
 quality is not bad, there is a „teaching mode“, recognized by preverbal infants
  lowered voice, words are formed carefully (part of „a natural pedagogy“)

🔎 [Search: Chomsky natural language acquisition](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=chomsky+natural+language+acquisition)

### 14. What is LoTH, the Language of Thought Hypothesis?

什么是思想语言假说？

mind operates through an internal language-like representational system.

📄 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_thought_hypothesis)  
📄 [Stanford entry](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/)

### 15. What is methodological solipsism?

什么是方法论唯我论？

a research strategy that focuses solely on an individual's mental states and inputs, ignoring the external world’s reality.

📄 [Wikipedia: Methodological solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_solipsism)

### 16. What are Fodor’s reasons for LoT?

他支持 LoT 的理由是什么？

a. We need a logically structured system for thought;
b. Natural language has systematic and compositional properties;
c. Systematicity: understanding "John loves Mary" implies understanding "Mary loves John";
d. Inferential coherence: reasoning can occur regardless of content.

(language is the only known system having properties a-d
3(4) reasons for adopting LoT:
 (a. we want it !)
 b. language has the properties a-d (and nothing else has them)
 attacked, saying L does not have it.. e.g „poetical L“
c systematicity (propositions can yield other propositions, eg reversal.
„John loves Mary“ implies the capacity to understand „Mary loves John“. )
(d inferential coherence, that we can infer things regardless of content)
• c and d: „logic in language“

## VI. Artificial Intelligence & Neural Networks

### 17. What is a(n artificial) neural network?

什么是（人工）神经网络？

brain-inspired computational models made of interconnected "neurons," used for pattern recognition and learning tasks.

system maintaining partial functionality even when components fail.

## VII. Perception, Will & AI

### 21. In perception, is there a reason to trust the subject?

在感知中，有理由相信主体吗？

Opinions vary: some trust subjective experience as a knowledge source, others stress potential errors and the need for external validation.

### 22. Tell the Wegner “I Spy” experiment and its findings

描述Wegner 的“I Spy”实验及其发现
