## V. Language & Learning

### 13. What are Chomsky’s ideas for natural language acquisition and their criticism?

arguments for motherese:
the teaching input is (utterances babies are confonted with)
 too little
 too „bad“ (low quality)
heavily criticized:
there is enough time, opportunities, „sessions“
 quality is not bad, there is a „teaching mode“, recognized by preverbal infants
  lowered voice, words are formed carefully (part of „a natural pedagogy“)

 (a. we want it !)
 b. language has the properties a-d (and nothing else has them)
 attacked, saying L does not have it.. e.g „poetical L“

„John loves Mary“ implies the capacity to understand „Mary loves John“. )
(d inferential coherence, that we can infer things regardless of content)
• c and d: „logic in language“
